                        <p class="text-dark">As coronavirus cases increased, the government began directing Kenyans to wear masks whenever they are in public. However, accessing masks became a challenge for many, as they were unaffordable. This led to cases of harassment
                            by police officers enforcing the mask directive.</p>
                        <p>With many Kenyans living from hand to mouth, and the slowdown in economic activity, buying a mask is not a priority for many low-income earners.</p>
                        <p>As a way to help make masks more accessible, we started making reusable cloth face masks and distriuting to the community for free. This was our covid 19 response project targeting the vulnerable groups of people in Kisumu county.
                            Since May 2020 ,we have produced over 35,000 masks and channelled to the rural areas and informal settlements to support the elderly,children,women and people living with disability by preventing community transmission of the
                            virus.
                        </p>
                        <p>We relied on community donations who provided local workshop for use in making homemade masks for the community. more young women volunteers joined us, and we started designing and tailoring face masks following World Health Organization
                            guidelines. To date, we have distributed over 46,000 face masks to low-income families in Kisumu county. This includes children, street vendors, boda-boda (motorcycle) operators, the elderly, and other people in need. we also
                            partnered with other youths and grassroots network of young people to carry out awareness and sensitization programs in the community on ways to mitigate COVID-19.</p>

                    Initiative and executed by a team of 6 female volunteers. Each kit distributed during the project implementation contained a pair of pants, tissue paper, soap and sanitary towel. It was conducted for five months since August to December
                    2020 on the 8th of every month and the target group was a sample of bright, needy adolescents. Initially, it started with 30 girls but rose to a total of 40 girls towards the end of the project. The beneficiaries were mainly aged between
                    13 to 22 years of age and extremely fit for this program considering their vulnerability during the Covid-19 pandemic. 4 of them are university students, 3 are still in primary school and the other 22 are in high school. They were
                    carefully identified from Kisumu East and West Sub-counties.</p>
