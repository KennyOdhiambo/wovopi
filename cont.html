<h3>MASK UP SAVE LIVES PROJECT</h3>
<p>As coronavirus cases increased, the government began directing Kenyans to wear masks whenever they are in public. However, accessing masks became a challenge for many, as they were unaffordable. This led to cases of harassment by police officers enforcing
    the mask directive.</p>
<p>With many Kenyans living from hand to mouth, and the slowdown in economic activity, buying a mask is not a priority for many low-income earners.</p>
<p>As a way to help make masks more accessible, we started making reusable cloth face masks and distriuting to the community for free. This was our covid 19 response project targeting the vulnerable groups of people in Kisumu county. Since May 2020 ,we have
    produced over 35,000 masks and channelled to the rural areas and informal settlements to support the elderly,children,women and people living with disability by preventing community transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>We relied on community donations who provided local workshop for use in making homemade masks for the community. more young women volunteers joined us, and we started designing and tailoring face masks following World Health Organization guidelines. To
    date, we have distributed over 46,000 face masks to low-income families in Kisumu county. This includes children, street vendors, boda-boda (motorcycle) operators, the elderly, and other people in need. we also partnered with other youths and grassroots
    network of young people to carry out awareness and sensitization programs in the community on ways to mitigate COVID-19.</p>

<h3>GIRLS TALK</h3>
<p>WOVOP in collaboration with other partners continues to increase the number of girls transiting successfully to higher levels of education through mentorship and life skills acquisition. We also advocates for policy changes towards greater SRHR and protection
    of girls from violence and discrimination in school and at home. We involve men and boys as key players in acting as allies for girls’ rights by enhancing their capacity on the same. GIRLS TALK provides platforms for gilrs from disadvantaged backgrounds,
    many of them orphans, the opportunity to acquire basic education on sexual reproductive health, life skills and financial support to escape the cycle of poverty and empower the next generation by recipient girls giving back to their societies.
</p>


<h3>PEACE TALKS</h3>
<p>We inadvertently promote a culture of conflict and violence, and our children and students do not learn the ways of peace. The need for resilience for the adverse nature of trauma in the communities and also to increase the young women participation in
    peace processes for early preparation. The program encouragse women and girls to embrace the culture of sharing their problems, worries and feelings by speaking out to inspire other girls and young women to come out and speak for effective stress
    and trauma healing management. The program provides a safe space or platform for women and girls to get to share their stories learn and understand life challenges. It targets students in learning institutions (primary, secondary and universities)
    in established peace clubs. Due to covid the program has shiftd focus to the general community with the establishment of PEACE CORNERS In each of the 7 sub counties of Kisumu county ,each headed by 2 peace champions ,a lady and a gentleman.The aim
    is to engage young people mespecially women in identifying challenges and risks nthat undermine peace and security n the sub counties by placing them at the apex in playing a critical role in identifying, mitigating and responding to conflicts in
    the community as well as uplifting their voices to be active participants in the prevention and peace building in Kisumu county</p>


<h3>DIGITAL ADVOCACY</h3>
<p>We use social media as a tool for advocating for peace agenda by hosting continues tweet chats and zoom meetings for gender and peace education purposes.During covid 19 peak,we utilixed to a greater extent facebook,tweeter,instagram and zoom and google
    meet platforms to keep our audience updated on the covid 19 virus by constantly providing information about the Dos and Donts according to WHO guidelines.We trained over 50 young women on social media use for advocacy ,engaged over 3000 youth on tweet
    chats for a period of 6 months on issues of concern to them.</p>
<h3>COLOR UP PEACE KENYA</h3>
<p>We are currently running a campaign called color up peace Kenya through partnership with color up peace from ukraine.The intension of the campaign is to understand what peace means to you and me (Kenyans only)</p>
<p>We will turn the photos into coloring pages and create a country-specific coloring book for Kenya! The coloring book will be freely downloadable from the website of Color Up Peace.</p>
<p>The campaign has seen 47 county represnattives brpught together in a platform to moblixe more people in submitting images of what peace looks like in every county.</p>


<h3>SISSY PROGRAM</h3>
<p>The Sissy Package project is a menstrual hygiene kit consisting of a combination of various items required by every girl during menstrual period to ensure menstrual hygiene and management. The aim of the project was to assist 30 vulnerable Adolescents
    and Young Women in accessing proper menstruation packages during Covid 19 PEAK MONTHS. The project was funded by Mrs. Mary Otieno, UON Student Counselor, organized by Grace Orao, Project Lead at Women Volunteers for Peace Initiative and executed by
    a team of 6 female volunteers. Each kit distributed during the project implementation contained a pair of pants, tissue paper, soap and sanitary towel. It was conducted for five months since August to December 2020 on the 8th of every month and the
    target group was a sample of bright, needy adolescents. Initially, it started with 30 girls but rose to a total of 40 girls towards the end of the project. The beneficiaries were mainly aged between 13 to 22 years of age and extremely fit for this
    program considering their vulnerability during the Covid-19 pandemic. 4 of them are university students, 3 are still in primary school and the other 22 are in high school. They were carefully identified from Kisumu East and West Sub-counties.
